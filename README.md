# 🥗 PRODiGY ML Task 05 – Food Recognition using CNN (CIFAR-10 Simulation)

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to simulate food recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. This task was completed as part of the Machine Learning Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a CNN model that can classify food items. Due to storage limitations, the **CIFAR-10** dataset was used to simulate food categories, allowing for rapid prototyping and training on a lightweight image dataset.

---

## 📂 Dataset: CIFAR-10

- 60,000 images (32x32 RGB) across 10 classes
- Used as a proxy for food categories
- Classes (e.g., airplane, bird, truck) are treated as symbolic food groups for simulation

---

## 🧠 CNN Model Architecture

- 2 Convolutional layers (ReLU + MaxPooling)
- Flatten + Dense layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Output layer with softmax (10 classes)

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 📈 Results

- Trained for 10 epochs
- Accuracy: ~70–75% on test data
- Efficient simulation of food recognition pipeline

---

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
3. Run all cells step-by-step  
4. Dataset loads automatically — no need to download
